Compiling typeerrors/Strategies/UnSoundUseless.hs
The type rule for "x +++ y" is not correct
  the type according to the type rule is
    Bool -> Bool -> Int
  whereas the standard type rules infer the type
    Int -> Int -> Int

The type rule for "x +++ y" contains the following unsound constraints:
a == Bool   : {Typing Strategy}
b == Bool   : {Typing Strategy}

The type rule for "x +++ y" contains the following useless constraints:
a == c   : {Typing Strategy}
d == e   : {Typing Strategy}

The type rule for "x +++ y" is missing the following constraints:
a == Int   : {Typing Strategy}
b == Int   : {Typing Strategy}
