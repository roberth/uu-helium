The modules in this directory can be loaded and/or compiled to show
that indeed the Helium/lvmrun installation works as aspected. We assume that the 
executables have been installed in the usual places including the libraries.
We do not depend on setting of LVMPATH here, but if you have that set,
you ought to be able to remove the -P options.

Helium without overloading:
helium  -P/usr/local/helium/lib/simple:. Simple.hs
and then
lvmrun -P/usr/local/helium/lib/simple:. Simple.lvm

Helium with overloading:
helium --overloading -P/usr/local/helium/lib:. Overloaded.hs
lvmrun -P/usr/local/helium/lib:.  Overloaded.lvm

Note that Overloaded.hs can also be compiled by Hugs,
but that execution can fail due to out of memory problems.
