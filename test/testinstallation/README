The modules in this directory can be loaded and/or compiled to show
that indeed the Helium/lvmrun installation works as aspected. We assume that the 
executables have been installed in the usual places including the libraries.
We do not depend on setting of LVMPATH here, but if you have that set,
you ought to be able to remove the -P options.

Helium without overloading:
helium -b -P/usr/local/helium/lib/simple:. Simple.hs
and then
lvmrun -P/usr/local/helium/lib/simple:. Simple.lvm

Helium with overloading:
helium -b --overloading -P/usr/local/helium/lib:. Overloaded.hs
lvmrun -P/usr/local/helium/lib:.  Overloaded.lvm

Note that Overloaded.hs can also be compiled by Hugs,
but that execution can fail due to out of memory problems.

The purpose of the -b flag is to make sure the file is compiled, even if an lvm file already exists.

If you happen to have a Helium server running, then you can test it by 

helium -P/usr/local/helium/lib -P. -v -b --enable-logging --debug-logger --portnumber=port --hostname=host Overloaded.hs

where port and host describe your server configuration. If you happen to have 
the server running on port 5010 on your own machine, then this setting works out to 

helium -P/usr/local/helium/lib -P. -v -b --enable-logging --debug-logger --portnumber=5010 --hostname=localhost Overloaded.hs

You can also see, due to the -v and --debug-logger flags, what actually happens.
Hopefully, you shall see a message that a handshake occurred, indicated by a "OK".
Otherwise, you should use the output to find out what is going on. For that, inspect the actual arguments as determined
by Helium, at the start of the output generated by the -v flag.

Finally, an example to test texthint, the simplest available interpreter for Helium:

texthint -P/usr/local/helium/lib -P . --overloading Overloaded.hs

or

texthint -P/usr/local/helium/lib:. --overloading Overloaded.hs

and if you like

texthint -P/usr/local/helium/lib/simple:. --no-overloading Simple.hs

Note that you must explicitly pass the directory where the Prelude.lvm etc. are located, as well
as the location of any modules you use, including, surprisingly maybe, 
I am not happy with this, and would like to automatically add the directory where the loaded file is located
automatically to the -P. This remains a TODO.
New in texthint is that all parameters passed to it are passed on to Helium, and all -P options are
passed (in a form suitable) on to lvmrun. This was not the case in earlier versions of texthint.
