<H1>Helium, differences when compared to Haskell 98</H1>


<UL>

<LI>Data type, show function
<LI>The module system is very simple:
	<UL>
	<LI>Everything is always exported: data types, functions, synonyms, instances.
	<LI>It is not allowed to import something via two different import declarations.
	    This means that if you have a module A and both B and C import A and then a fourth
	    module D imports both B and C that you will get clashes for all the names
	    from module A.
	<LI>You can hide functions in an import declaration with <TT>hiding</TT>; you cannot
	    hide the show... functions that are generated for each data type. Hiding other
	    things like types and constructors is not possible.
	<LI><TT>qualified</TT> imports and imports with <TT>as</TT>
	</UL>
<LI>The following character sequences are supported in characters and strings:
		\\, \n, \a, \b, \f, \r, \t, \v, \", \'.
	Other escape sequences like the ones with numbers are not supported.
<LI>Numeric literals are not overloaded. <TT>3</TT> is of type <TT>Int</TT> and
    <TT>3.0</TT> is of type <TT>Float</TT>

</UL>
